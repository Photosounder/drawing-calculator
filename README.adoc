# Michel Rouzic's drawing calculator

Here's what it does:

- Enter an algorithm in https://github.com/Photosounder/rouziclib#rlip-rouziclib-interpreted-programming[RLIP].
- Each time you call `symb` it adds a circle to a list of circles to draw. The first two arguments are the X-Y position, the next argument is the circle radius (same units as the position), and the next four arguments are red-green-blue-alpha in linear values in the 0 to 1 range.
- The program just draws from that list of circles.

As with all my projects it depends on https://github.com/Photosounder/rouziclib[rouziclib] for all the heavy lifting so it needs to be in your include path.

## Usage

### How to zoom

The interface is zoomable as explained https://github.com/Photosounder/rouziclib-picture-viewer#zooming[here]. Basically by clicking the middle mouse button you enter the zoom-scroll mode so you can zoom (using the scroll wheel) and adjust the selection with more precision. You exit that mode by clicking the middle mouse button again or better yet reset the view by holding the middle mouse button for at least half a second.

### Full screen

You can press Alt-Return to switch between full screen or windowed mode.

## Example formulas

### Bokeh 3D sphere

This one creates a 3D sphere with bokeh. Adjust the knob for variable `k0` for how the dots spin up the sphere, `angle` to make it rotate and `k1` to adjust camera focus.

```
d i = 0
i_loop:
  expr d north = (i-0.5)/2 
  expr d west = i * k0 + 0.25 + angle
  expr d p.x = cos_tr_d2(west) * cos_tr_d2(north)
  expr d p.y = cos_tr_d2(north-0.25)
  expr d p.z = cos_tr_d2(west-0.25) * cos_tr_d2(north)

  expr d rad = abs(p.z-k1) * 0.02
  expr d mul = .00003/sq(rad)

  // Colours
  expr d red = 0.2 * mul
  expr d grn = 0.2 * mul
  expr d blu = 0.8 * mul

  // Draw symbol
  d v = symb p.x p.y rad red grn blu 1

  i = add i .001
i i_cond = cmp i <= 1
if i_cond goto i_loop
return 0

```

### Bubble universe

Adapted from x.com/yuruyurau/status/1226846058728177665[this tweet]. Use `k0` to make time move forward (hold the Alt key to make it happen smoothly).

```
d num_curves = 256
d iter = 200
d t = k0
d alpha = 1
d radm = 0.01
d r = 2pi/235
d tr = 1/(2pi)

d i = 0
i_loop:
  d p.x = 0
  d p.y = 0

  d j = 0
  j_loop:
    // Position
    expr d a = i*r + t + p.x
    expr d b = i + t + p.y
    expr p.x = cos_tr_d2(a*tr-0.25) + cos_tr_d2(b*tr-0.25)
    expr p.y = cos_tr_d2(a*tr) + gaussian(b)

    // Radius
    expr d rad = radm * (1 - (j / iter))

    // Colour
    expr d red = sq(i / num_curves)
    expr d grn = sq(j / iter)
    expr d blu = sq(1-(i/num_curves+j/iter)/2)

    // Draw symbol
    d v = symb p.x p.y rad red grn blu alpha

    j_end:
    inc1 j
  i j_cond = cmp j < iter
  if j_cond goto j_loop

  i = add i 4
i i_cond = cmp i < num_curves
if i_cond goto i_loop
return 0
```
